Hello Everyone, 
My name is Swapnil Agashe, at the time of creating this repository I am studying at IIT Bombay pursuing chemical Engineering but my interests lie in data science and artificial intelligence.

I have commented on almost every line of the code so that even a beginner with some idea of python will be able to follow.

Here I have created a simple Neural Network moderl using Keras.

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

We will train the model using MNIST Fashion dataset.

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

The original MNIST dataset contains a lot of handwritten digits. Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. "If it doesn't work on MNIST, it won't work at all", they said. "Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others."

This is a simple neural networks model without the use of CNN. I will make a CNN model soon that will be trained with CIFRA dataset.

Thank you.
